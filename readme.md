## Snake
This is an implementation of the classic game "Snake". The original source is from [CodingNepal](http://youtube.com/codingnepal).

### Bugs
- Fix the bugs:
  - Snake cannot be turned downwards.
  - Food is always in the same corner.
  - Score does not increase.
  - Game stops, if snake reaches the top area.

### Extensions
- The snake's head should have a different color than the tail.
- Make the playground variable in size.
- Increase the speed of the snake after eating N food elements. Or include next levels that can be reached after eating M food elements.
- Include a timer that forces the player to get the next food element quickly.
